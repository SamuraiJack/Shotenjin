TASKS
=====

- Optimize away trailing empty string "" if no expression were emitted 
- Optimize away 'output' in __context[0].output? Seems we don't replicate stash anyway..


- Implement transport for JX.N.D via SpiderMonkey&JavaScript and add already compiled&beautified template to constructor

- Add ability for helper script to extract template body from external file


- map embedded template instance to 'my'?

- treat templates as methods and implement a special type of methods, which will allow that (needs to be wrapped with 'echoRaw'):

Template('Table', {

    templates : {
    
        cell : {
            sources : '...'
        },
        
        row : {
            sources : '[%= this.cell() %]'
        },
        
    }
})
